# project-euler-rust
 My solutions to Project Euler problems in the Rust programming language. A bit about my methodology is detailed below.

## Regarding posting solutions.
 Answers to many of the Project Euler problems are already available online elsewhere, in a variety of programming languages; anyone who finds some strange joy in entering numbers into a box is welcome to do so using other resources online already. I do not see this project as me providing solutions to these problems for others, but rather cataloging my experience learning the Rust programming language through solving these problems.

## Regarding the use of libraries/packages (crates).
 I feel no shame in using crates (as Rust calls them) with already implemented algorithms contained therein to solve these problems. I am not solving these problems for their mathematical content (I already did so in other programming languages years ago). As of writing this, I am still new to Rust, and I am doing this *for the purpose* of learning Rust; if taking on this project causes me to discover useful crates, then I will have gained more from that than I would have if I were to have instead implemented the algorithm for the Nth time myself.
